          <p>
            At Dhirubhai Ambani International School, we recognize the
            imperative of imparting an educational experience that is
            world-class in every respect and which prepares children for global
            citizenship. We are a school with an Indian mind, an Indian heart
            and an Indian soul; a school that celebrates the culture of
            excellence and is an embodiment of values. We believe that a
            curriculum of excellence with a global dimension is central to the
            education of children, so it prepares them to face the challenges of
            the 21st century with confidence and strength of character.
